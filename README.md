## SOLID Principles
> What are these principles?
>> Set of rules to be followed to design a better software.

To keep our systems to be easily readable, understandable, extensible, easy to debug and easy to test we adhere to few basic principles. The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help in creating maintainable, scalable, and flexible software systems. SOLID is an acronym for a set of design principles in object-oriented programming. The five principles of SOLID are

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that every class or module in a software system should have only one responsibility, i.e., only one reason to change. This means that a class or module should have a well-defined and narrow purpose, and it should not be responsible for multiple unrelated tasks.
